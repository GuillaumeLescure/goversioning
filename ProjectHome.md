GoVersioning (gov) is a decentralized versioning software, a source code manager and a revision control system. The idea is to make it as simple as Subversion but as powerful as Git. To do so, commands have to be short and obvious without a lot of parameters. But inside, the inner workings have to allow a lot of possibilities. The result will be quite similar to Mercurial but with modern parallelization and more efficient patch system.
